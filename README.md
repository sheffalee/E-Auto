# E-Auto

eAuto is requesting assistance creating a computer vision model to collect customer demographic information at their car wash.
This project requires dataset creation/expansion and model building. There will be a camera mounted at the front of the carwash to collect either video or photos as cars enter the carwash.

eAuto wants to try to identify/collect the following:

The brand (i.e., the logo) of the customerâ€™s car.
The customer demographic information.
They are open to discussing other information that can potentially be collected. The collected information will be used to identify the demographic disproportionately using the carwash only so that eAuto can target this demographic to attract them into using their other services (specifically their auto shop). The car information will then be used to identify what products to offer in the auto shop.
